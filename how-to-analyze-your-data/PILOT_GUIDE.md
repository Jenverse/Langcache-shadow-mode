# LangCache Shadow Mode - Customer Integration Package

## 🎯 What is Shadow Mode?

Shadow Mode lets you **test LangCache semantic caching risk-free** in your production environment. It runs alongside your existing LLM calls without affecting your users, collecting data to show you exactly how much LangCache would improve your performance and reduce costs.

## 📦 What We're Providing You

### 1. **Shadow Mode Wrapper** (Drop-in replacement)
- Single Python file that wraps your existing LLM calls
- Zero changes to your user experience
- Automatic data collection and analysis

### 2. **Complete Setup Guide**
- 5-minute integration instructions
- Environment configuration
- Testing and validation steps

### 3. **Analytics Dashboard**
- Real-time performance metrics
- Cost savings calculator
- Hit rate analysis
- Detailed reporting tools

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Download the Shadow Mode Wrapper
```bash
# Download our shadow mode wrapper
curl -O https://your-langcache-domain.com/shadow/langcache_shadow.py

# Or we'll email it to you as an attachment
```

### Step 2: Set Your Credentials
```bash
# Add these to your environment variables
export LANGCACHE_SHADOW_MODE=true
export LANGCACHE_API_KEY=your-provided-api-key
export LANGCACHE_CACHE_ID=your-provided-cache-id
export LANGCACHE_BASE_URL=https://api.langcache.com
```

### Step 3: Wrap Your LLM Calls (One Line Change)
```python
# BEFORE (your existing code)
import openai
response = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_query}]
)

# AFTER (with shadow mode)
from langcache_shadow import shadow_llm_call
response = shadow_llm_call(
    openai.chat.completions.create,
    user_query,  # <- add this parameter
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_query}]
)
```

### Step 4: Run Your Application Normally
- Your users see **exactly the same responses** as before
- Shadow mode runs in the background collecting data
- Zero impact on performance or user experience

**Common Questions:**
- "Will this slow down my application?" → No, shadow mode runs asynchronously
- "What if I want to stop early?" → Just set `LANGCACHE_SHADOW_MODE=false`
- "Do you see my user data?" → No, all data stays in your environment
- "How much work is integration?" → Usually under 10 lines of code changes
