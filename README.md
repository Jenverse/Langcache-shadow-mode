# 🔍 LangCache Shadow Mode

**Test semantic caching risk-free in your production environment**

Shadow Mode lets you validate LangCache's performance alongside your existing LLM applications without affecting your users. See exactly how much you'll save in costs and latency before committing to semantic caching.

## 🎯 What is Shadow Mode?

Shadow Mode runs **parallel** to your production LLM calls:

```
User Query
    ↓
Your Application
    ├─► LLM (Production Response) ──► User Gets This ✅
    └─► LangCache (Shadow Test) ──► Data Collection Only 📊
```

- ✅ **Zero Risk**: Users always get LLM responses (never cached)
- ✅ **Zero Changes**: Minimal code modification required  
- ✅ **Real Data**: Test with your actual production queries
- ✅ **Concrete Results**: See exact cost savings and performance gains

    model="gpt-4o-mini", 
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": query}]
)

# AFTER  
from langcache_shadow import shadow_llm_call
response = shadow_llm_call(
    openai.chat.completions.create,
    query,  # ← Add this
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": query}]
)
```

### Questions?

**Common Questions:**
- *"Will this slow down my application?"* → No, shadow mode runs asynchronously
- *"What if I want to stop early?"* → Just set `LANGCACHE_SHADOW_MODE=false`
- *"Do you see my user data?"* → No, all data stays in your environment
- *"How much work is integration?"* → Usually under 10 lines of code changes
